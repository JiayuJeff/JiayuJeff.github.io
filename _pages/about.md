👋 Hi, I’m @JiayuJeff, a second year CS student in [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/).


💞️ I’m interested in Playing [piano](https://youtu.be/5r_Y9tE_fbo?si=Rnv-_KuOYPt7_rPF), [violin](https://youtu.be/-ohoA3pO9Ks?si=8ZsqIn7GO0pp31UR), football and [working out in gym](http://xhslink.com/a/GeNO8R9xpvx0)


🌱 I’m currently learning topics about Natural Language Processing, especially on NLP application in [information fact-checking](https://aclanthology.org/2024.fever-1.14.pdf) and verbal uncertainty elicitation and calibration


👀 I am serving as a research assistant in [HKUST KnowComp Group](https://github.com/HKUST-KnowComp), and I’m open to collaboration in research topics related to AI


🖋️ Here is my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PIQxhfMAAAAJ&hl=en)  


📫 You can reach on my school email: jliufv@connect.ust.hk

**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
