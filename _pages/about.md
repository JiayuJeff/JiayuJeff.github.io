👋 **Welcome to my homepage!** 🥂  
I’m **Jiayu LIU 刘家毓**, a junior undergraduate CS student supervised by [Prof. Yangqiu Song](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yqsong/) and [Prof. Yiren Fung](https://mayrfung.github.io/) at [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/).

💞️ I’m passionate about playing [piano](https://youtu.be/5r_Y9tE_fbo?si=Rnv-_KuOYPt7_rPF), [violin](https://youtu.be/-ohoA3pO9Ks?si=8ZsqIn7GO0pp31UR), football, and working out in the gym.

🌱 Currently, I am focusing on:

- **Improving LLM trustworthiness:** Training robust and reliable LLMs to se
- **Evaluating and enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities:** 
- **Advanced tool-use capabilities in agentic systems:**
