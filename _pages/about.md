üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Jiayu LIU, a second year CS student in [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/).


üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm passionate about playing [piano](https://youtu.be/5r_Y9tE_fbo?si=Rnv-_KuOYPt7_rPF), [violin](https://youtu.be/-ohoA3pO9Ks?si=8ZsqIn7GO0pp31UR), football and [working out in gym](http://xhslink.com/a/GeNO8R9xpvx0).


üå± I‚Äôm currently interested in Natural Language Processing, especially in:
- Improving model truthworthiness: [information fact-checking](https://aclanthology.org/2024.fever-1.14.pdf) and [verbal uncertainty elicitation and calibration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24778).
- Enhancing model reasoning capabilities: How current SoTA Large reasoning models fail in reasoning process and how we could implement post-training algorithms beyond simple accuracy to enhance their performance.


üñãÔ∏è Here is my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PIQxhfMAAAAJ&hl=en).


üì´ You can reach me on my school email: jliufv@connect.ust.hk. I am actively seeking collaborations and feel free to connect!
