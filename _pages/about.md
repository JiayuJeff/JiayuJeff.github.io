👋 Hi, I’m Jiayu LIU, a second year CS student in [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/).


💞️ I’m passionate about playing [piano](https://youtu.be/5r_Y9tE_fbo?si=Rnv-_KuOYPt7_rPF), [violin](https://youtu.be/-ohoA3pO9Ks?si=8ZsqIn7GO0pp31UR), football and [working out in gym](http://xhslink.com/a/GeNO8R9xpvx0).


🌱 I’m currently interested in Natural Language Processing, especially on NLP application in [information fact-checking](https://aclanthology.org/2024.fever-1.14.pdf) and verbal uncertainty elicitation and calibration.


👀 I am a research assistant in [HKUST KnowComp Group](https://github.com/HKUST-KnowComp), and I’m open to collaboration in research topics related to AI.


🖋️ Here is my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PIQxhfMAAAAJ&hl=en).


📫 You can reach me on my school email: jliufv@connect.ust.hk
