👋 **Welcome to my homepage!** 🥂  
I’m **Jiayu LIU 刘家毓**, a junior undergraduate CS student at [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/). I am currently a exchange student in [UIUC](https://illinois.edu/) and an undergraduate research intern at [BLENDER lab](https://blender.cs.illinois.edu/index.html) advised by [Prof. Ji Heng](https://blender.cs.illinois.edu/hengji.html). Previously, I was supervised by [Prof. Yangqiu Song](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yqsong/) and [Prof. Yiren Fung](https://mayrfung.github.io/) at HKUST. My current research focuses on:

- **Advanced tool-use capabilities in agentic systems:** Building high-performing, cost-effective agents
- **Evaluating and enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities:** Pinpointing the crucial flaws in LLM reasoning and training diverse-thinking reasoning models
- **Improving LLM trustworthiness:** Analyzing LLM confidence elicitation patterns and training well-calibrated LLMs, especially in knowledge enhanced scenarios

## Misc

In my spare time, I’m passionate about music and sports. I play the piano and violin, and I also enjoy singing and sharing my performances on social media. For sports, football is my absolute favorite—I’m a member of both the HKUST Mainland Students Football Team and the Guangdong Experimental High School Football Team, and I truly cherish the memories and friendships from those times. I also enjoying sailing in the sea, and yatching makes me feel an incredible sense of freedom.

Feel free to check out some of my music:
