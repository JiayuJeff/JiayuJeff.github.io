üëã Welcome to my homepage! :D ü•Ç I‚Äôm Jiayu LIU, a third year CS student in [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/).


üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm passionate about playing [piano](https://youtu.be/5r_Y9tE_fbo?si=Rnv-_KuOYPt7_rPF), [violin](https://youtu.be/-ohoA3pO9Ks?si=8ZsqIn7GO0pp31UR), football and working out in gym.


üå± I‚Äôm currently interested in Natural Language Processing, especially in:
- Improving LLM trustworthiness: [GProofT](https://aclanthology.org/2024.fever-1.14.pdf) (FEVER 2024), [MarCon](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-short.18.pdf) (ACL2025 Main), [MarPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08992) (Under review in ACL rolling review), [CritiCal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24505) (Under review in ACL rolling review).
- Evaluating and enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities: [RFMDataset](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.17114) (MathNLP 2025, under review in ACL rolling review), [Multirole-R1](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2507.20187) (under review in ICLR).
- Advanced tool use capabilities in agentic systems: CostBench.
